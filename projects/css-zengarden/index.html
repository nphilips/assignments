                    Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags, 
                    incompatible <span>DOM</span>s, broken <span>CSS</span> support, and abandoned browsers.
                </p>

                <p>
                        We must clear the mind of the past. 
                        Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the 
                        tireless efforts of folk like the <span>W3C</span>, <span>WASP</span>, and the major browser creators.

                        The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important

            </article>
            <section>
                <p>
                        There is a continuing need to show the power of <span>CSS</span>. 
                        The Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire, 
                        and encourage participation. 
                        To begin, view some of the existing designs in the list. 
                        Clicking on any one will load the style sheet into this very page. 
                        The <span>HTML</span> remains the same, the only thing that has 
                        changed is the external <span>CSS</span> file. Yes, really.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                        <span>CSS</span> allows complete and total control over the 
                        style of a hypertext document. 
                        The only way this can be illustrated in a 
                        way that gets people excited is by demonstrating 
                        what it can truly be, once the reins are placed 
                        in the hands of those able to create beauty from 
                        structure. Designers and coders alike have 
                        contributed to the beauty of the web; we can 
                        always push it further.

                        Strong visual design has always been our focus. 
                        You are modifying this page, so strong <span>CSS</span> 
                        skills are necessary too, but the example 
                        files are commented well enough that even 
                        <span>CSS</span> novices can use them as starting points. 
                        Please see the <span class="linky"><span>CSS</span> Resource Guide</span> for 
                        advanced tutorials and tips on working with <span>CSS</span>.
                    </p>

                    <br>
                    
                    <p>
                        You may modify the style sheet in any 
                        way you wish, but not the HTML. 
                        This may seem daunting at first if you’ve 
                        never worked this way before, but follow 
                        the listed links to learn more, and 
                        use the sample files as a guide.

                    <p>
                        Download the sample HTML and CSS to 
                        work on a copy locally. 
                        Once you have completed your masterpiece 
                        (and please, don’t submit half-finished work) 
                        upload your CSS file to a web server under 
                        your control. Send us a link to an archive 
                        of that file and all associated assets, 
                        and if we choose to use it we will download 
                        it and place it on our server.

                        This site serves as equal parts inspiration 
                        for those working on the web today, learning

                    Where possible, we would like to see 
                    mostly <span>CSS 1 & 2</span> usage. <span>CSS 3 & 4</span> 
                    should be limited to widely-supported 
                    elements only, or strong fallbacks 
                    should be provided. The CSS Zen Garden is 
                    about functional, practical <span>CSS</span> and not the 
                    latest bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2% 
                    of the browsing public. The only real 
                    requirement we have is that your <span>CSS</span> validates.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Luckily, designing this way shows how well 
                    various browsers have implemented <span>CSS</span> by now. 
                    When sticking to the guidelines you should see 
                    fairly consistent results across most modern 
                    browsers. Due to the sheer number of user agents 
                    on the web these days — especially when you 
                    factor in mobile — pixel-perfect layouts may 
                    not be possible across every platform. 
                    That’s okay, but do test in as many as you can. 
                    Your design should work in at least IE9+ and the 
                    latest Chrome, Firefox, iOS and Android browsers 
                    (run by over 90% of the population).

                    We ask that you submit original artwork.

                    visual themes to your work. 
                    We’re well past the point of needing 
                    another garden-related design.
