Not mario themed, but that doesnt really matter.  Its a cool concept and functional.  :)

Thank you for having perfect indentations and line space in all your files.  It is very readble.

All your class and variable names are clear and concise.  Keep that up.  

Once you are done with a project delete any unnecessary console log's or commented out code unless you plan to go back and continue where you left off.

Nicely done. Your code looks great.
