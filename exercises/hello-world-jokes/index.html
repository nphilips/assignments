    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <ul>
        <li id="knot">A string walks into a bar. The bartender says,
             "I'm sorry, but no knots allowed. So the string left. 
             The string messed up his hair, got himself all in a twist, 
             and came back into the bar. The bartender said, 
             "Hey, weren't you just in here?" 
             to which the string replied, "I'm a frayed knot."</li>
        <li id="drugs">I bought my shoes from a drug dealer. 
            I don't know what he laced them with, 
            but I've been tripping all day.</li>
        <li id="stick">What's brown and sticky? A stick.</li>
