Databases - MERN

2 Main Types: 
    - Relational
        - SQL
        - Enforce Rigidity by default
    
    - Non-relational
        - MongoDB
        - Give me whatever you want, I'll save it
        - Mongoose - enforces rigidity with mongoDB


Mongoose:
    1. Write Document /(Resource)    Schemas/Model (Blueprint)
        - Enforces rigidity much like a relational DB table.
    2. Give us methods to query our DB with
    3. Connects to our DB
